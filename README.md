Coursera - Data Scientist's Toolbox

Hi My name is Slamet Pramono, I am currently working as a web developer. I used
to work for PT Hero Supermarket Tbk as IT Support/HelpDesk. However, I felt that
I need to move to further develop my career.

Now, I am happily working for Digify.us. Name aside, it is not a US based
company but rather an Indonesian one. We build websites mainly using PHP and
sometimes .Net. I myself prefer Python as primary language to use. I will
*persuade* my Boss to use Python.

When I was in college I dreamt to be a data analyst, however it didn't go as I
expected. My dream had been expiring as I worked as IT Support/HelpDesk. I don't
see that my new job as a webdeveloper will do any good, but it is still not too
late to keep dreaming on.
